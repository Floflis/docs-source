## Introduction

After [downloading a version of Floflis](https://floflis.github.io/cli/download/), read this page for official instructions on installing.

## Before installing

**Note**: You can skip this step if your device haves enough storage space available. If the target device is limited (like a WiFi router), this pre-install step will be needed, except when you'd already downloaded the Lite version.

If you wish to remove the updates module (which includes .git folder), please copy the `Floflis DNA` folder, so you will have a copy which you can update (`git pull`).

Inside the clonned/downloaded extracted folder, open Terminal and type the following:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 init.sh && sudo ./init.sh
```

Respond to questions and the script will configure the installer for you.
After done, you can move the `Floflis DNA` folder to your device.

## Installing

Assuming `Floflis DNA` folder is on the target device, run the following command inside this folder:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
```

Insert your password, and Floflis will be installed.
