## Floflis is Linux?

Floflis is Floflis.
Currenty its OSes (Floflis OS, UniOS) are based in Ubuntu/RaspiOS, which depends upon Debian/Linux kernel. But it can be moved into anything.

Actual dependence:

```
Unix
  -- Linux kernel
<<<<<<< HEAD
    -- GNU OS/Debian/Ubuntu (or RaspiOS)
=======
    -- GNU OS/Debian

```

## Floflis focuses on HTML5?

<<<<<<< HEAD
Floflis Central is made in HTML5. Etcher, IPFS Desktop, Aragon, Frame and others are, too.

But the shell and the prompt are Rust!
=======
Also, Floflis is already working to replace Debian, while keeping backwards compatiblity.

## Can I install common Linux/Debian/Ubuntu apps on this HTML5 OS?

Floflis isn't yet a HTML5 OS (althought Floflis Screens is - as based in Firefox OS), but even when it becames one, you will ever have the possibility to install Linux programs on Floflis. And right now, you can install and use Linux programs. Also, there are lots of classical programs built-in and usable, such as CJDNS, Firefox, etc.

## Why Floflis focuses on HTML5?
>>>>>>> 00eaafe8877adeef389e7acd16a565c6bb54398b

HTML5 apps are JavaScript apps.
JavaScript is the most popular programming language, and lots of enterprises are easily porting their web apps to Electron/Cordova for keeping an unified code base.

But Floflis works well without these webby apps; the first layers - from DNA to Soil - focuses in native apps. Even the upper layers prefers some native software instead of HTML5.

## Can I install common Linux/Debian/Ubuntu apps on this HTML5 OS?

Floflis isn't a HTML5 OS (althought Floflis Screens is). Floflis' main focus, from the ground of its first layers, are native programs; principally Rust.

## Floflis loves Electron?

Floflis is currently needing Electron, but we could also replace it to other platform that uses Gecko/Rust or any other.

## Does it relies on NPM?

Most Electron apps relies on NPM packages. But the main package manager of Floflis are APT and UniStore.

We are studying how to put NPM to alternatively use IPFS.

## Can I develop apps, games, .HTML5 files and fonts for Floflis?

Yes, of course.

Just head up to our [Developers section](/dev/).
