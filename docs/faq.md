## Floflis is Linux?

Floflis is Floflis.
It actually is based on Debian, which depends upon Linux kernel. But it can replace anything if to be better.

Actual dependence:

```
Unix
  -- Linux kernel
    -- GNU OS/Debian
      -- Cinnamon Desktop Environment
```

We are open to replace Linux to any better kernel if it exists (not because of its CoC; the new kernel should have a inclusive Code of Conduct like Linux haves).

Also, Floflis is already working to replace Cinnamon DE and Debian, while keeping backwards compatiblity.

## Can I install common Linux/Debian/Ubuntu apps on this HTML5 OS?

Floflis isn't yet a HTML5 OS, but even when it becames one, you will ever have the possibility to install Linux programs on Floflis. And right now, you can install and use Linux programs. Also, there are lots of classical programs built-in and usable, such as CJDNS, Firefox, etc.

## Why Floflis focuses on HTML5?

HTML5 apps are JavaScript apps.

JavaScript is the most popular programming language, and lots of enterprises are easily porting their web apps to Electron/Cordova for keeping a unified code base.

Floflis could have a kernel that is mainly in JS (for a new kind of "BIOS"), compiled to native language for classical devices. It makes Floflis inclusive for any kind of developer. Thought your grandma developing a new feature for a OS kernel with Eventlr? It is possible.

## Floflis loves Electron?

Floflis is currently needing Electron, but we could also replace it to other platform that uses Gecko instead of Chromium.

## Is Floflis a web OS?

Floflis isn't focused on web, but focuses on HTML/JavaScript.

Unlike Chrome OS, Floflis thinks all apps should be offline-first, and focusing on limited/slow connections, while also working great on hi-speed 24/7 online devices.

## Does it relies on NPM?

Most Electron apps relies on NPM packages. But Floflis' packages aren't automatically updated, and NPM will be replaced by a decentralized package manager: APM (Aragon Package Manager).

## Can I develop apps, games, .HTML5 files and fonts for Floflis?

Yes, of course.
