Seeing the need to compress files to make smaller .ISO file, and to run Floflis in other platforms (routers, IoT, handheld gaming consoles), I had the idea of Floflisâ€™ Layers, which makes Floflis modular and lightweight.

Bellow are the layers explained:

## Recipe

Not a working layer, but it contains references of compilers (for any supported platform) and source-codes. Recipe layer will only be available after Core layer.

## DNA

The most lightweight layer, focused on the most weak hardware (routers, IoT, etc).
Includes:

* Floflis CLI
* Installer

Floflis `DNA` can upgrade to Floflis `Core` or just install need parts of it (and also from `Substratum`).

## Core

Very lightweight, can run from a intermediary router to even a Nintendo DS. Focused on IoT devices. Totally based on CLI. Includes:

* Directory scheme (tree, /1 folder)
* CJDNS + Yggdrasil
* NodeJS
* Dat protocol

### PRO version

Floflis Core PRO, despite its name, is totally free.

Floflis Core can be upgraded to its PRO version, which contains:

* CLI web browser (Lynx)
* CLI games
* Sounds
* Audio player

## Substratum

Initially thought for Playstation 2. Contains a very basic UI (remembers Windows 1/3) that remembers a CLI, although can render some graphics.

* IPFS (with improvements to be lightweight)
* Ethereum system/APIs
* Aragon + APM
* Dillo web browser
* Video player with audio player

IPFS and Aragon can be installed from Floflis `Core` or `DNA`.

## Base

A lightweight desktop version, thought to run on Windows NT/95 machines and above.

* Midori web browser (need to be compatible with Dillo browser)
* HTML5 apps (needs a lightweight webview that works on old devices)
* Lightweight version of VLC Media Player

## Home

For intermediary computers.

* Electron
* HTML5Apps Platform
* Firefox web browser (need to be compatible with Midori browser)
* VLC Media Player

## Ultimate

Contains all feature sets.

* Application layers/loaders (Windows, MacOS, Android)
* Advanced media softwares (video/audio composition/edit, DVD creation)
* others, from feature sets and packs

## Quantum

As Windows keeps with practically the same disk size, Floflis Quantum is because a OS needs evolution.

* Blu-ray as installation media, and comes with BD disk reader/creator software
* P2P server features
* Fancy, 3D animations
* Lots of transitions and effects

So, this is the dependence scheme, including layers:

```
BIOS/UEFI
  -- Unix/Firmware
    -- Linux kernel
      --Floflis DNA
        -- Floflis Core
          -- BSD/GNU OS/Debian
            -- Floflis Substratum
              -- Cinnamon Desktop Environment
                -- Floflis Base
                  -- Floflis Home
                    -- Floflis Ultimate
                       -- Floflis Quantum
```
