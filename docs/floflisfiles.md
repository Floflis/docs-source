## .HTML5

<img width="100px" src="../img/icons/application-x-html5.png">

`.HTML5` files are a parody of `.SWF` files, while `HTML5 Player` is a parody of `Shockwave Flash Player`.

They have CSS and JS all embedded inline on the same file.

These files are useful as simple/lightweight applications or games.

Images can also be embedded, through base64. Sounds are still in the workaround.

Futurely, these files will also have their "zipped" version; so any inline file that makes loading slower will load "externally".

**Note**: HTML5 Player isn`t yet implemented.
